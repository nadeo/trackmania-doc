# What is Royal?

Royal maps are comprised of 5 sections, each with increasing difficulty. The colors indicate the difficulty in the same order as the seasonal campaigns (white, green, blue, red, black). Royal maps usually involve moving objects, tricks, and air and speed control.

Royal can be played in Solo (by opening a Royal map via the track browser).
