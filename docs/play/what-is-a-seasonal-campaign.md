# What is a seasonal campaign?

## Seasonal Campaigns explained

Trackmania's seasonal campaigns consist of 25 maps of varying styles which are split into 5 increasing difficulties: White, Green, Blue, Red, and Black.

Seasonal campaigns run for 3 months after which the records leaderboards are closed and a winner is crowned, however new records can still be driven in the permanent, individual map records leaderboards.

Each campaign map has 4 medals you can earn: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and the coveted Author medal.

By earning medals on the campaign tracks, you can also unlock the seasonal campaign [Prestige Skins](/create/garage/prestige-skins/) and gain trophies for completing each section of the campaign.

At the end of a season, you will earn Trophy points based on your overall rank in the campaign. The winner of the entire campaign earns the rare Trophy 9 in-game as well as a physical trophy.

## Campaign rankings

Campaign rankings are based on points assigned per map rank (which are added together for the overall ranking).

The points distribution per map can be seen below. For an interactive experience, see [this unofficial calculator](https://geri43.github.io/TrackmaniaSeasonPointCalculator/).

Note that these rankings are not updated in real time and may take a few hours to reflect the current standings.
