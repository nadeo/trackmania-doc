## Seasonal Campaigns explained
Trackmania's seasonal campaigns consist of 25 maps of varying styles which are split into 5 increasing difficulties: White, Green, Blue, Red, and Black.

Seasonal campaigns run for 3 months after which the records leaderboards are closed and a winner is crowned, however new records can still be driven in the permanent, individual map records leaderboards.

Each campaign map has 4 medals you can earn: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and the coveted Author medal.

By earning medals on the campaign tracks, you can also unlock the seasonal campaign [Prestige Skins](/prestige-skins) and gain trophies for completing each section of the campaign.

At the end of a season, you will earn [Trophy points](/trophy-points) based on your overall rank in the campaign. The winner of the entire campaign earns the rare Trophy 9 in-game as well as a physical trophy.
