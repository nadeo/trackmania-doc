# What are the arcade channels?

Arcade channels, also known as arcade rooms, are online multiplayer servers that can feature a variety of game modes and user-generated tracks.
The most common game mode you'll see played on the channels is "Time Attack", a mode where the goal is to set the best time possible within a given timeframe.
You can find a curated list of arcade channels by navigating as follows from the main menu: `Play -> Live -> Arcade`

## Experience a taste of the Arcade with Starter Access

Starter Access players have limited access to the Arcade. 
They can either play on the Seasonal Campaign room or they can try their hands at the ever-changing Arcade Program, located in the top right in the Arcade menu. There, several different arcade programs are scheduled one hour at a time, ensuring variety and different styles of tracks.
