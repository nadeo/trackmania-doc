# How to report a player

All Trackmania players have to follow the official [Trackmania Code of Conduct](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/129161/trackmania-code-of-conduct).

When encountering players in the game that you want to report *for their in-game behavior or for cheating*, you can do one of the following:

- Report them in-game.
- Report them via the official Trackmania website.
- Report them through the relevant Ubisoft support form.

See the sections below for detailed instructions.

All submitted cases will be referred to the people in charge at Nadeo - keep in mind however that you will not receive details as to which actions were taken, if any.
Please use these official channels only and **do not use social media, DMs, the official TM Discord or any other place to report someone**.

## In-game reports

In-game, visit the player's profile (e.g. by clicking their name in a room's leaderboard and selecting their profile) and find the *Report* button on that screen.

Then just follow the on-screen instructions to send your report.

## Trackmania website

Visit the [official Trackmania website](https://www.trackmania.com), log in and find the offending player.
If you're having trouble with that, you can search for them on [trackmania.io](https://trackmania.io) first and use the `Trackmania.com` button on there to get to the right place.

On that page, find the *Report* button - it might be hidden in a dropdown menu. Follow the instructions there to send your report.

Note that using this website, you can also report individual maps and/or clubs - just find their page and click the *Report* button.

## Ubisoft support

Head over to the [official Ubisoft Support website](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/contact).

- **Platform**: Your platform of choice
- **Game**: Trackmania
- **Category**: Player Reports, Bans, and Sanctions
- **Sub-Category**: Learn the Rules/Report a player

Using these settings, you'll also be able to attach screenshots and other files using the *Attach documents* option.
Note that selecting *Report a player* will initiate a live chat with a support agent, while *Learn the Rules* just requires you to send a report.
