# What are Competitions?

Competition activities allow for the creation of ingame competitive events via the usage of the Competition Tool.

These activities cannot be created in the game and instead have to be created on the [Competition Tool website](https://admin.trackmania.nadeo.club/).

For more help with the competition tool, please refer to the [Competition Tool category](/club/competition-tool/) of this documentation.
