# Prestige skins

Prestige skins are a form of in-game achievement that you can gain in several different ways.
Getting prestige levels unlocks special skins with lights on the rims and around the cockpit that show off your prestige level.

## Seasonal skins

Seasonal prestige skins are based off the medals you earn during the season.

You can progress your prestige by gaining medals in the current **seasonal campaign** and all **Tracks of the Day**, **Weekly Shorts** and **Weekly Grands** (time on track + lap count) released during the current season.

| Prestige | Max Level | Medals per level | Medals for max level |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Bronze   | 7         | 3                | 21                   |
| Silver   | 9         | 5                | 45                   |
| Gold     | 11        | 7                | 77                   |
| Author   | 13        | 9                | 117                  |

To obtain a prestige skin you must first reach the maximum level of the previous rank and the first level of the current rank.

- The **Bronze skin** unlocks at level 1 of the Bronze Prestige (3 bronze medals)

- The **Silver skin** unlocks at level 7 of the Bronze Prestige (21 bronze medals) and level 1 of the Silver Prestige (5 silver medals)

- The **Gold skin** unlocks at level 9 of the Silver Prestige (45 silver medals) and level 1 of the Gold Prestige (7 gold medals)

- The **Author skin** unlocks at level 11 of the Gold Prestige (77 gold medals) and level 1 of the Author Prestige (9 author medals)

**All medals are accounted for** - if you reached a higher prestige level before unlocking the respective skin, you'll gain the prestige skin of that level once you meet the above mentioned requirements.

## Ranked skins

To unlock Ranked skins, obtain the rank and you'll get its skin.

To level up, keep the rank for another month.
