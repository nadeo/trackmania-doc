# Weekly Grands Guidelines

!!! info "Official information"

    This article was contributed by Ubisoft Nadeo and contains official information about Weekly Grands as of February 13th 2026.

The Weekly Grands game-mode is designed and introduced as a chill/zen game-mode where players of all skill levels can enjoy gameplay of racing in laps against collidable opponents called "Clones".

This game-mode is, like the Weekly Shorts tracks, free to play and therefore should remain accessible to lower skilled players, but can be enjoyed on Sundays by all audiences as well as via the Weekly Grand Enduro race, which takes place on the Weekly Grand track selected for that week.

Clones are automatically generated and saved on your creation when you enable this feature in the Track Editor. Clones will follow the racing lines of your validation ghost when you decide your track’s Author Medal.

As we are now opening player-created track submissions for this game-mode, we would like to present to you some guidelines for your creations that must be followed in order to be considered for selection.

## Track length

**The average lap of your track must not exceed 1 minute of racing time, and should not be shorter than 45 seconds.**

This should be keeping in mind the average player's skill level more than an expert's - so if you are a very good player & track builder, 1 minute laps at your skill level may be considered slightly too long - keep it on the safe side in this case. A good Weekly Grand will take approximately between 10 minutes and 11 minutes to complete the 10 laps.

## Author Medal difficulty

While not as strict as the Weekly Shorts, Author Medal difficulties should still be reasonable. We will not allow very difficult medals - as many players consider this or the automatically calculated gold medals a prestigious goal at their skill level to aim for. For the Weekly Grands, we set a general guideline (with some variance allowed) of the AT being **roughly 11 laps worth of driving** on your track, excluding the first lap time.

As an example, if the average lap on your track is 58 seconds, we would ask to ensure the Author Medal is obtained at approximately 10 minutes and 38 seconds. (11 x 58 = 638 seconds)

## Submitting for review

**Your track must be validated with 10 laps driven and Clones feature enabled.**

It needs to be submitted to the Weekly Tracks Review Server, which now accepts both Shorts & Grands submissions.

The clones will not be displayed in the Review Server, so that players can judge your track fairly without frustration of collisions. When Nadeo reviews your track, clones will be checked to ensure they are driven reasonably.

## Track names

**Weekly Grand track names should be recognisable by including the prefix "G - " when submitted to the Review Server.**

Please avoid very long track names or low effort track names such as "My First Map" or "I Couldn’t Think Of A Map Name".

Some good examples would be:

- G - Lush Loops
- G - Grand Canyon Journey
- G - Route 67

## Difficulty of your design

In the Weekly Grands, it is the Clones feature that is adding difficulty to the driving. Avoid driving your validation run with erratic, intentionally odd driving patterns to introduce extra difficulty - they should follow the path of your track more or less as intended.

**Your track itself must have some _chill_ obstacles that can be overcome easily and do not add frustrations or demand high precision driving from players.**

**Do not introduce hard speed-checks or difficult tricks that must be performed.** (Sorry, no bug-slides, mandatory ice-sliding or flips for the Weekly Grands!)

Avoid introducing obstacles or unreasonably sharp turns at high speeds, narrow roads or unsmooth jumps that could cause mistakes easily for lower skill players. The obstacles should be fair and avoidable.

Weekly Grands is not there to impress with creative interactions, odd physics or difficult-to-understand trick combinations. It is meant to be a friendly and zen-mode multi-lap track where racing the clones is the primary difficulty.

## Introducing labels for Weekly Grands for feedback from Nadeo

Nadeo have added new feedback labels specifically for Weeky Grands:

- **No Clones**: Your track does not have Clones enabled.
- **Wrong Laps Amount**: Your track does not have the required 10 laps set.

Additionally, it is recommended for mappers to select the new _Grand_ label for their submissions to clearly identify their maps as Weekly Grand submissions.
