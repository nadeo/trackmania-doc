    This feature requires an active **Standard Access** or **Club Access** subscription.

Map review is a feature in Trackmania that allows players to play and review maps that have been created by other players, as well as submit their own maps for review and feedback.

Map review is a valuable area for mappers to receive feedback and achieve a better understanding of how to improve as a mapper. In order to join map review and play other maps that were created by fellow community members follow these instructions below:

## Navigating the menus

Upon launching the game and loading into the main menu, you will see several options to select from. In order to locate the map review server, first select the **CREATE** button.

Lastly, you will have the option to choose from either the **TRACK OF THE DAY** or **WEEKLY TRACKS** servers.

The aim of these servers is to provide an honest rating of the maps displayed on their functionality in **Cup of the Day**/**Weekly Shorts**/**Weekly Grands** and/or offer advice to mappers in order to help improve a map's quality overall.
